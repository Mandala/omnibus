Package route wraps gorilla/mux the HTTP request multiplexer package. It adds
some nifty features such as middleware handling, subrouter with function
closures with group, and method handler shorthands. This package mostly has
the same API function syntax but does not directly compatible with library
mix-and-matching because it has some wrapper to pass the middleware
information.

For more information about the Gorilla Mux package documentation, please
head over to http://godoc.org/github.com/gorilla/mux.
